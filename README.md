## Hi There! :) <br/>

I'm a Chemistry student at the National University of Colombia. <br/>
I'm passionate about science, technology, and how programming can be applied to support data analysis in chemistry, whether experimental or theoretical.<br/>

Currently, I'm learning Python, C++, R, among others, and working on projects related to chemistry, statistics, and data analysis.<br/>

I use GitHub to document my learning process, share academic projects, and connect with others who love science and coding.  <br/>
Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out â€” I'm always happy to collaborate or learn something new!<br/>
